% Enhanced Epidemic Modeling with Progressive Susceptible Population Decline

% Parameters
population_size = 50000;% Adjust to your specific neeeds be warned that it will affect run time
initial_infected = 1;%I want to start with only one infected person. While this could make
%the model run for a long time, this can be adjusted
% Define the number of time steps
time_steps = round(100);% Running the simulation for about 100days.I have initialized 
%my timesteps as daily, meaning i am recording number of infected,recovered
%and susceptible individuals daily.For 100 which is an arbitrary number.
% Defining the vaccination rate and social distancing factor
vaccination_rate = 0.7; %70% of susceptible individuals get vaccinated each time step
social_distancing_factor = 0.5;% Reduces the probability of infection by 50%

% Defining the infection probability
infection_probability = 0.05;% 5% chance of a susceptible individual getting infected each day
%which means thereâ€™s a 5% chance of a susceptible individual getting infected each day.
recovery_duration = 14; % The number of days an infected individual takes to fully recover
%i.e 14 

% Initialize health status
health_status = zeros(population_size, 1);%Each element in this array represents the 
%health status of an individual. Since  all values to zero, it implies that everyone 
%is currently healthy (susceptible)
health_status(randperm(population_size, initial_infected)) = 1; % Infected individuals

% Initialize counts
% Initialize the counts
%The codes below are used to keep track of the number of susceptible,
%infected and recovered individuals at each time step.
susceptible_count = zeros(time_steps, 1);
infected_count = zeros(time_steps, 1);
recovered_count = zeros(time_steps, 1);

        health_status(susceptible_to_infect) = 1;

    % Vaccination

        end
