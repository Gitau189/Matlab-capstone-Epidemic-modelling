# Matlab-capstone-Epidemic-modelling 🤒
 This MATLAB project develops an agent-based simulation to model infectious disease spread within a population and analyzes the effectiveness of mitigation strategies like vaccination and social distancing. 

# Disclaimer ❗
It should be noted that this is a very simple model and does not take into account alot of factors such as population density e.t.c.

It is aimed to give  a solid foundation on matlab and its applications.

## acknowledgement 🙏
I want to acknowledge  Grace Mgandila and Halima For their outstanding collaboration working on the model.
