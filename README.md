# Matlab-capstone-Epidemic-modelling ü§í
 This MATLAB project develops an agent-based simulation to model infectious disease spread within a population and analyzes the effectiveness of mitigation strategies like vaccination and social distancing. 
# How the code works
All files with '2' contribute to the simulation done without taking to account mitigation stategies such as vaccination and social distancing,while all files with '3' contribute to the simulation done  taking to account mitigation stategies such as vaccination and social distancing.

'Run_Sim' files initiates the simulation and generates plots in accordance to the simulation.
# Disclaimer 
It should be noted that this is a very simple model and does not take into account alot of factors such as population density e.t.c.

It is aimed to give  a solid foundation on matlab and its applications.

## Acknowledgement üôè
I want to acknowledge  Grace Mgandila and Halima Mahdi For their outstanding collaboration working on the model.
